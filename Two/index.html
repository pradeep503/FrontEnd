    Birdbill dayflower or commelina dianthifolia is very appropriate to be grown in containers where you can combine 
    it with other longer-lasting plants. It prefers moist and well-drained soil and full sunlight or partial shade 
    during most of the day time. This flower only blooms for a day but is a pretty 
    addition to any garden. Blossoms come from one stem as, usually, there are three blue petals on each. ">
